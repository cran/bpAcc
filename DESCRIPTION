Description: A comprehensive statistical analysis of the accuracy of blood
         pressure devices based on the method of AAMI/ANSI SP10 standards
         developed by the AAMI Sphygmomanometer Committee for indirect
         measurement of blood pressure, incorporated into IS0 81060-2. The 
         'bpAcc' package gives the exact probability 'of accepting a device D'
         derived from the join distribution of the sample standard deviation
         and a non-linear transformation of the sample mean for a specified
         sample size introduced by Chandel et al. (2022) and by the Association
         for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (2003, ISBN:1-57020-183-8).
